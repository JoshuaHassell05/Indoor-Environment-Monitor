# Indoor-Environment-Monitor

An end-to-end IoT indoor environmental monitoring system using an **ESP32 + BME680** with both a **local Flask (Raspberry Pi)** backend and a **cloud AWS serverless** backend, plus a live web dashboard.

## ✅ Project Status: Completed
This project is fully implemented and operational. The ESP32 collects sensor data, transmits it to either a local or cloud backend, stores readings, evaluates risk levels, and displays live + historical data on the dashboard.

## Goal of the Project
Build a small, portable device capable of monitoring indoor environmental health indicators such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Gas resistance (VOC / air quality proxy)

This project demonstrates:
- Embedded firmware development (ESP32)
- Sensor communication (I2C)
- Wireless networking (Wi-Fi, HTTP/HTTPS)
- Backend API development (Flask + AWS Lambda)
- Cloud deployment (API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3)
- Real-time dashboard design

---

## Implemented Features
- Reads environmental data from a **BME680** sensor over I2C
- ESP32 sends JSON packets to:
  - Local Flask server (HTTP), or
  - AWS API Gateway (HTTPS)
- Backends receive, store, and serve readings via REST APIs
- Web dashboard displays:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Pressure
  - Gas resistance / VOC indicator
- Risk evaluation states:
  - **SAFE**
  - **ELEVATED**
  - **WARNING**
- Historical charts with time-bucketed averages (day / week / month)

---

## Setup Overview
- **Firmware:** Configure Wi-Fi locally and choose local vs cloud target using headers in `firmware_esp32/include/`
- **Local backend:** Run Flask on Raspberry Pi from `server_rpi/`
- **Cloud backend:** Deploy serverless stack from `cloud_aws/` using AWS SAM
- **Dashboard:** Serve locally (Flask) or upload to S3 for cloud hosting

## Hardware List
- ESP32 Dev Board (ESP-WROOM-32)
- BME680 Environmental Sensor
- Raspberry Pi 
- Breadboard + jumper wires
- USB cables for power/programming
